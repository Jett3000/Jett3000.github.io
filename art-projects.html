            <p>These figures are created by laying out Bezier curves on a line or circle and giving them a rotation based on a Perlin noise value generated from their coordinate.</p><img src="assets/img/mermaid.webp">
            <p>I saw an opportunity in the sweeping lines and their proximity, realizing that a brush following their path would have an easy time pushing paint around on the paper. To create this painting, drops of watercolor are placed (mostly) in the predicted path of the brush before plotting.</p>

            <p>Created with fellow DurmPAC member Celia Ruley for Durham's Safety and Wellness Taskforce report.</p>
            <p>The illustration, from Celia, was inspired by weightlessness and the metamorphosis of youth. I focused on the background inspired by quilting, interpreting tiles as individuals in a community.</p>

            <p>At the end of September, I vended at a local art market for the first time, where I made many new friends. One such friend asked if I had used the Fibonacci Series in my work before, which sparked conversation and inspiration.</p>
            <p>I didn't have a piece along those lines ready, so I got to work imagining how it may play out on the page. The spaces between each line grows with the series, wrapping in the horizontal dimension and dropping in the vertical.</p>
            <p>To bring controlled chaos to the cascading lines, I gave their endpoints a slight offset provided by a two-dimensional Perlin noise field.</p>

            <p>When I think of Perlin noise, two common techniques stand out amongst the rest: flowfields and layers of wavy lines. One of my first ever generative art projects was the latter, which has today evolved into these layered ley lines.</p>

            <p>This is the second year that I've designed promotional materials for a youth artist exhibit featured at The Hayti Heritage Center's annual Juneteenth Celebration.&nbsp;This year, I had the pleasure of not only designing the promotional poster, but also being a part of the selection panel and installing the exhibit.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Near and dear to my heart, Sawubona was my first large web project, as well as the first project of <a href="https://durmpac.art">DurmPAC</a>. The Collective put out an art call for BIPOC/LGBTQ youth in the triangle to feature their work in a zine. I worked closely with fellow designer <a href="https://celiaruley.com/">Celia Donnelly</a> to create a digital edition to accompany the printed zine. Sawubona features a p5.js cover sketch and nine pieces of artwork from local youth artists.</p>
