I'm constantly amazed by the fact that so much of our world is run by computers, which are fairly simple at the lowest physical and mathematical levels. The fact that humans have curated complex behavior from computers like the Internet or Mars rovers is nothing short of magic to me. The more I learn about each layer of abstraction between the simple to the complex, the more I learn about magic itself.</p><h1>In COMP550</h1><p>I got to learn a great deal about the design and analysis of algorithms. From optimizing matrix chain multiplication orders to finding the greatest common subsequence of characters in two list, our class explored different paradigms such as divide-and-conquer algorithms, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming. Like most of the computer science courses that I've taken at UNC, the curriculum focused more on the theory and math behind the algorithms than their implementation. I often learn best by doing, however, so I implemented a few of our class topics on my own time.</p><p>One such topic was the select algorithm, which takes a list and a number less than or equal to the number of elements in the list. The algorithm then returns the i<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;order statistic of the list. In other words, if you give it a list and the number 3, you'll get back the third smallest number. This can obviously be done efficiently by sorting the list, which should only take O(n * log(n)), but the select algorithm I've implemented has a time complexity of O(n).</p><p>Another fascinating pair of algorithms we covered was Prim's&nbsp;Minimum Spanning Tree and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms. I took a particular liking to Prim's version, and implemented a few visualizations for it. I'll leave a two-dimensional version below, feel free to check out the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Jett3000/full/J0R4gzpJf">three-dimensional edition</a> as well.</p><div id="prim-holder" style="width: 100%;max-height: 400px;min-height: 200px;margin-bottom: 10px;"></div><h1>In COMP431</h1><p>I learned about the Internet and the protocols that keep it running. This class was one of the most eye opening courses I've ever taken. When we first began delving into the way that data is broken into pieces and sent off to its destination, there was a moment in class where I wondered to myself, <em>how many packets are whizzing by me right now?</em>&nbsp;I considered my laptop first, naturally, then my phone, then the fact that every person in the room most likely had a laptop and a phone, and some had smart watches too. Then, the projectors for the class, which connected wirelessly, then the portable console in my backpack. I realized I would not run out of items to list, while considering only one room of one building of one university.</p><p>I ate lunch on the quad that day, enjoying the sunshine and peaceful weather. I thought about everyone out there with me, and all of our phones in our pockets, getting push notifications and sending more packets while the screen isn't even on. I wondered what life would be like if I could see the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we put these messages on, and I imagine that they would be brighter than the sun.</p><p>For an in class assignment, I wrote a SMTP mail server and mail client in Python. It was nice to learn about the ways that email worked before I was born, and to see the cute quirks of that period in internet history (the server says Hello!). But the assignment truly landed for me when our professor revealed that nothing had been watered down or altered for the assignment: our mail servers really could process and send emails! This was when I realized that the Internet is anybody's playground, and that I wanted to run around in it until my legs gave out.</p><p>This class also informed my use of sockets in a commissioned project, which I'll soon have written up <a href="blank">here</a></p><div style="height: 50vh;"></div></div></main><script src="/assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/prims.js"></script></body></html>
