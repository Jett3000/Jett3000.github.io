I am lucky to be a founding member of this youth organized art collective that is actively uplifting my home community of Durham, with a focus on the marginalized identities within the community.</p><h1>As a webdesigner,</h1><p>I created DurmPAC's website,&nbsp;<a href="https://durmpac.art">durmpac.art</a>, from scratch using Bootstrap Studio, much like the website you're reading now. We use our website to introduce our team, our projects, and to open a line of communication with community members. We also host the <a href="https://durmpac.art/sawubona.html">digital edition of Sawubona</a>, our first zine, on DurmPAC's website. Sawubona's digital edition is an engaging webpage of the poetry, paintings, and photographs that were selected for the zine. The cover features a fullscreen animation I created using the JavaScript Library p5.js.</p><a href="https://durmpac.art/sawubona.html"><img style="max-width: 100%;margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/assets/img/sawubona%20cover.png"></a><h1>As a digital designer,</h1><p>I've worked closely with another talented artist and DurmPAC member, Celia Ruley. Together we are DurmPAC's design team, which means we handle everything from promotional posters to Instagram infographics. We use Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator to get information out clearly and beautifully.</p><div style="height: 50vh;"></div></div></main><script src="/assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
